# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

<br>

## Getting Started

<br>

- Install all dependencies.
```
npm install
```
- Run the development web server using the following command.
```
node express_server.js
```

- Visit the following URL to start navigating the web application *after* running the server
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

### ***bcrypt issue possible solution***

After running `npm install` you might encounter an error regarding `bcrypt` depending on the system OS that you are running. 

A `bcryptjs` package is installed and commented at the start of `express_server.js` file. Please comment the import for `bcrypt` and comment-out the `bcryptjs` import.
